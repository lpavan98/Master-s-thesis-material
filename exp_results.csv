During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen.

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen.

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

The meaning of such concepts will be made clear to you. You will in fact see a description of each concept on top of the screen.</p><p>During the experiment, you will be shown three objects. The same three objects will be shown to another participant, who, unlike you, will need to learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the three objects will be underlined for you, but not for the other participant. You need to communicate either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em> to the other participant. Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation. On the right part of the screen, you will see the record of trials you completed.</p><p>We suggest to keep a finger of the right hand on the <em>p</em> key and a finger of the left hand on the <em>q</em> key (ideally the index fingers).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant.

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

The meaning of such concepts will be made clear to you. You will in fact see a description of each concept on top of the screen.</p><p>During the experiment, you will be shown three objects. The same three objects will be shown to another participant, who, unlike you, will need to learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the three objects will be underlined for you, but not for the other participant. You need to communicate either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em> to the other participant. Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation. On the right part of the screen, you will see the record of trials you completed.</p><p>We suggest to keep a finger of the right hand on the <em>p</em> key and a finger of the left hand on the <em>q</em> key (ideally the index fingers).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects.

The meaning of such concepts will be made clear to you. You will in fact see a description of each concept on top of the screen.</p><p>During the experiment, you will be shown three objects. The same three objects will be shown to another participant, who, unlike you, will need to learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the three objects will be underlined for you, but not for the other participant. You need to communicate either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em> to the other participant. Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation. On the right part of the screen, you will see the record of trials you completed.</p><p>We suggest to keep a finger of the right hand on the <em>p</em> key and a finger of the left hand on the <em>q</em> key (ideally the index fingers).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

The meaning of such concepts will be made clear to you. You will in fact see a description of each concept on top of the screen.</p><p>During the experiment, you will be shown three objects. The same three objects will be shown to another participant, who, unlike you, will need to learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the three objects will be underlined for you, but not for the other participant. You need to communicate either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em> to the other participant. Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation. On the right part of the screen, you will see the record of trials you completed.</p><p>We suggest to keep a finger of the right hand on the <em>p</em> key and a finger of the left hand on the <em>q</em> key (ideally the index fingers).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined.

The meaning of such concepts will be made clear to you. You will in fact see a description of each concept on top of the screen.</p><p>During the experiment, you will be shown three objects. The same three objects will be shown to another participant, who, unlike you, will need to learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the three objects will be underlined for you, but not for the other participant. You need to communicate either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em> to the other participant. Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation.

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects.

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

The meaning of such concepts will be made clear to you. You will in fact see a description of each concept on top of the screen.</p><p>During the experiment, you will be shown three objects. The same three objects will be shown to another participant, who, unlike you, will need to learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the three objects will be underlined for you, but not for the other participant. You need to communicate either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em> to the other participant. Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation. On the right part of the screen, you will see the record of trials you completed.</p><p>We suggest to keep a finger of the right hand on the <em>p</em> key and a finger of the left hand on the <em>q</em> key (ideally the index fingers).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

The meaning of such concepts will be made clear to you. You will in fact see a description of each concept on top of the screen.</p><p>During the experiment, you will be shown three objects. The same three objects will be shown to another participant, who, unlike you, will need to learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the three objects will be underlined for you, but not for the other participant. You need to communicate either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em> to the other participant. Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation. On the right part of the screen, you will see the record of trials you completed.</p><p>We suggest to keep a finger of the right hand on the <em>p</em> key and a finger of the left hand on the <em>q</em> key (ideally the index fingers).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation.

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined.

The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen.

The meaning of such concepts will be made clear to you. You will in fact see a description of each concept on top of the screen.</p><p>During the experiment, you will be shown three objects. The same three objects will be shown to another participant, who, unlike you, will need to learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the three objects will be underlined for you, but not for the other participant. You need to communicate either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em> to the other participant. Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation. On the right part of the screen, you will see the record of trials you completed.</p><p>We suggest to keep a finger of the right hand on the <em>p</em> key and a finger of the left hand on the <em>q</em> key (ideally the index fingers).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined.

That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen.

Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation. On the right part of the screen, you will see the record of trials you completed.</p><p>We suggest to keep a finger of the right hand on the <em>p</em> key and a finger of the left hand on the <em>q</em> key (ideally the index fingers).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

The meaning of such concepts will be made clear to you. You will in fact see a description of each concept on top of the screen.</p><p>During the experiment, you will be shown three objects. The same three objects will be shown to another participant, who, unlike you, will need to learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the three objects will be underlined for you, but not for the other participant. You need to communicate either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em> to the other participant. Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation. On the right part of the screen, you will see the record of trials you completed.</p><p>We suggest to keep a finger of the right hand on the <em>p</em> key and a finger of the left hand on the <em>q</em> key (ideally the index fingers).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

The meaning of such concepts will be made clear to you. You will in fact see a description of each concept on top of the screen.</p><p>During the experiment, you will be shown three objects. The same three objects will be shown to another participant, who, unlike you, will need to learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the three objects will be underlined for you, but not for the other participant. You need to communicate either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em> to the other participant. Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation. On the right part of the screen, you will see the record of trials you completed.</p><p>We suggest to keep a finger of the right hand on the <em>p</em> key and a finger of the left hand on the <em>q</em> key (ideally the index fingers).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen.

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. You will first see all objects associated a message and then all objects associated with the other one. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question.

This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined.

Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation. On the right part of the screen, you will see the record of trials you completed.</p><p>We suggest to keep a finger of the right hand on the <em>p</em> key and a finger of the left hand on the <em>q</em> key (ideally the index fingers).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

The meaning of such concepts will be made clear to you. You will in fact see a description of each concept on top of the screen.</p><p>During the experiment, you will be shown three objects. The same three objects will be shown to another participant, who, unlike you, will need to learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the three objects will be underlined for you, but not for the other participant. You need to communicate either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em> to the other participant. Your goal is to make sure that that participant picks the underlined objects among the three displayed ones.</p><p>Being unaware of the meaning of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the other participant will likely not be able to pick the right object in the first trials. However, both of you will be shown many sets containing three objects. In time, the other participant can thus learn the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and become more accurate in returning the object which you wanted to be returned (the one underlined for you).</p><p>During the whole task, please take your time and send the message that you think is best to send in each situation. On the right part of the screen, you will see the record of trials you completed.</p><p>We suggest to keep a finger of the right hand on the <em>p</em> key and a finger of the left hand on the <em>q</em> key (ideally the index fingers).</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,

During the experiment, you will be shown sets of three objects. The same sets of three objects were shown to another participant, in the same order in which they will be shown to you. That participant was informed about the meaning of the words associated with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, unlike you. That participant sent you a message (either <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>) for each set of objects. Such messages will appear next to each set of objects. The aim of the participant who sent the messages to you is to have you pick a certain object out of the three displayed ones, for each set of objects. Your task is in fact not only to learn the meaning of the two concepts, but also to select the object that the other participant wanted you to return.</p><p>Of course, in the first couple of trials you will have no idea about the meaning of the concepts in question. That should however change later on. As a help, you will see the record of the trials that you already completed on the right part of the screen. This means that you will see all sets of three objects that were shown to you before, with the one that you were supposed to pick underlined, together with the message sent by the other participant. There is no time limit to complete the task, so please focus on being as accurate as possible in returning the object that the other participant wanted you to return, and look at the right part of the screen for help in solving the task.</p><p> We suggest to keep three fingers on the <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> keys, which are the keys that you will need to use to indicate which object you select.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,
